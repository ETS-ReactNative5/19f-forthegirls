# For the Girls

For the Girls is a mobile application that connects women in technology based on technical and personal interests and location. Women can choose to be a mentor, mentee or looking for friends. Once women match, they can DM each other to see if they want to meet up in person for coffee or a meal. Through reminders, an events page and personality matching, we hope that the relationships and networks built through the app will last. Our goal is to alliviate feelings of isolation and imposter syndrome through building a strong network of women in technology.

## Architecture

To build our front end, we are using React Native. We used the Node.js framework for our project. In addition to this, we use Expo which provides tools to create a React Native application. We use axios to enable us to make API calls and eslint and babel as other libraries to help us build our application. 

## Setup

In order to set this up, you must set up the following by running this code in the command line (to make sure you have node and expo):

`brew install node`

`npm install expo-cli --global`

Then you should run:

`yarn install` to install any packages or libraries you may need.

## Deployment

To deploy the project, clone this repository. Then, do the setup above if you haven't already from the command line. Then, run `expo start` to deploy the project.
